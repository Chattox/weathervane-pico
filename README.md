# Weathervane Station Firmware

Based on Pimoroni's [Enviro](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviro) firmware, but heavily pared down and built specifically for the Weather board (and my specific set up).

## Installation

- Flash enviro board with the enviro distro of Pimoroni's build of [MicroPython](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases)
- Copy contents of `/src` over to the pico
- Create `utils/config.py`, fill out based on `utils/config_template.py`
